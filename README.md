# Decoding Similarity

This is a repo containing code demonstrating decoding similarity analysis on some pretrained deep networks as detailed in https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08197.  Use dependencies specified in .yml file and the .ipynb notebooks compare-two-networks-decoding-similarity.ipynb and compare-many-networks-decoding-similarity.ipynb for some demos. 

This repo is research code and a work in progress.  It is being updated frequently.
